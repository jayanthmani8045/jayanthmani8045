# 👋 Hi, I’m Jayanth Mani  

I’m a **Software Engineer and Cloud Developer** passionate about designing systems that merge **scalable cloud architecture, intelligent automation, and data-driven insights**.  
I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University (Boston)**, where I’m refining my expertise across **full-stack development, distributed systems, and machine learning**.  

My journey started in network engineering at **TCS**, where I automated real-time operations across 70+ global sites with **Python and C++**. Over time, that experience evolved into a love for building **end-to-end solutions — from backend APIs to cloud infrastructure and data pipelines**. Today, I build projects that push boundaries between **software engineering and applied AI**.
